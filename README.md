### Heyho, it's a Timo! ðŸ˜²ðŸ¦„

I'm a student of Artifical Intelligence. My interests include:
- Software Development
- Game Design
- Artificial Intelligence
- IT Security
- Storytelling
- Assembling computers

Usually working in C#, Java or Python. But also have seen and written (very little!) code in R, C++, Lua and JS.

There's a lot more to say about me, but who wants to spoil all the details :)
Maybe you'll find some by taking a closer look at my activities here.
In the meantime, have fun browsing!
